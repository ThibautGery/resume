\section{Summary}
Passionate developer for more than 7 years, I've developed and maintained critical production systems. Using quick customer feedback loop, I've been able to quickly iterate to create the right product. 

I enjoy writing functional programming code following software craftsmanship principles like TDD.

I look forward to join an agile team creating a product, close to its users, which owns its software from requirements to production.

\section{Professional Experience}

\cventry{2018 - 2020 \\(2 years)}
{Software Engineer}
{Snooper}
{FMCG startup}
{Australia}
{
Snooper provides brands with real time crowdsourced insights of retail in store execution: 
The data is captured by shoppers through a mobile app and is then aggregated into dashboards.
\\
Within a team of 3, in close relation with the founders, we redesigned the prototype into a platform between shoppers and brands in order to scale the business.
during my time the gross revenue grew by a factor of 4.
\\
I mostly worked on the admin \& user part of the platform with the product manager:
\begin{itemize}
\item fully created the mobile app using \textbf{React Native} and Expo
\item incrementally rewrote the API in \textbf{Kotlin} using Spring
\item pushed for and lead the implementation of \textbf{Clean architecture} in our backend
\item developed the frontends using \textbf{React} and React Admin
\item automated deployments \& infrastructure using \textbf{Terraform} on \textbf{AWS}
\item implemented error reporting using \textbf{Sentry} and monitoring/APM using \textbf{Datadog}
\item took part in recruiting \& mentoring the junior member of the team
\end{itemize}
All the code was reviewed by a peer, unit tested and the citical one e2e tested.
